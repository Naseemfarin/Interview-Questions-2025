1) Difference between code quality and code coverage.
    Code quality is about how good the code is.
    Code coverage is about how much of the code is tested.
    High code coverage does not guarantee high code quality, and vice versa; both are important for robust software.
2) Default quality gate in snar?
   A quality gate is a set of thresholds and rules (conditions) applied to code analysis results. If the code does not meet these conditions, the quality gate fails.
   The Sonar way quality gate is the default and recommended quality gate which focuses on keeping new code clean, rather than spending a lot of effort remediating old code.
   The Sonar way quality gate has four conditions: 
     No new issues are introduced
     All new Security Hotspots are reviewed
     New code test coverage is greater than or equal to 80.0%
     Duplication in the new code is less than or equal to 3.0%
