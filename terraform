1)Terraform provisioners. 
Terraform Provisioners are used for executing scripts or shell commands on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation/deletion.
Creation-time provisioners
  By default, provisioners run when the resource they are defined within is created. 
  Creation-time provisioners are only run during creation, not during updating or any other lifecycle. 
  They are meant as a means to perform bootstrapping of a system. So, if a creation-time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as tainted. A tainted resource will be planned for destruction and recreation upon the next terraform apply.

Destroy-time provisioners
If when = destroy is specified, the provisioner will run when the resource it is defined within is destroyed.

Destroy provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed. 
If they fail, Terraform will error and rerun the provisioners again on the next terraform apply.
Due to this behavior, care should be taken to destroy provisioners to be safe to run multiple times.

3) If we have created 3 instances using terraform script and the instance names are mentioned as a list
Suppose we removed 2nd instance name from the list and applied script again then what will happen to the already 3 instances created before.
  variable "instance_names" {
  default = ["instance-1", "instance-2", "instance-3"]
}

2 ways using count and for_each.
count:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = length(var.instance_names)
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = var.instance_names[count.index]
  }
}
for_Each:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  for_each = toset(var.instance_names)
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = each.value
  }
}

Approach
What happens when you remove "instance-2"?
count: "instance-2" destroyed, "instance-3" destroyed & recreated
for_each: Only "instance-2" destroyed; others untouched
